# Analysis of Algorithms

Cast of characters:
- Programmer needs to develop a working solution
- Client wants to solve a problem efficiently
- Theoretician wants to understand
- Basic blocking and tackling is sometimes necessary

Student might play any of all of these roles.

Charles Babbage - Analytic Engine

Reasons to analyze algorithms
- predict performance
- compare algorithms
- provide guarantees
- understand theoretical basis
- PRIMARY PRACTICAL REASON: avoid performance bugs

Algorithmic successes:
- Discrete Fourier transform: brute force is N^2 steps, FFT algorithm is NlogN steps
- N-body simulation (simulate gravitational interactions among N bodies). Brute force - N^2, Barnes-Hut algorithm - NlogN

A framework for predicting performance and comparing algorithms

Scientific method.
- Observe some feature of the natural world.
- Hypothesize a model that is consistent with the observations.
- Predict events using the hypothesis.
- Verify the predictions by making further observations.
- Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree. 

Principles.
- Experiments must be reproducible.
- Hypotheses must be falsifiable.

Example - 3 Sum Problem

Given N distinct integers, how many triples sum to exactly zero?
